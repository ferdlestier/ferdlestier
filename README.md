  <em>green leafed tree surrounded by fog during daytime</em>
  
  <em>Perhaps one the best vantage points in Richmond Park, London. This bench is perfectly placed beneath a lonely tree, giving a clear view of the open fields and woodlands in every direction. In the early morning mist there‚Äôs a certain melancholy about the place - you could sit and ponder life here, without a care in the world.</em>
