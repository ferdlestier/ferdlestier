  <em>the night sky is filled with stars and the milky</em>
  
  <em>I have taken this shot at Putangirua Pinnacles Scenic Reserve at about 12AM just a few days ago. While the Milky Way core isn't at its brightest at this time of year, it's still impressing how  bright stars appear on a clear night sky in New Zealand.
I was also trying my new Sigma 16mm f1.4 for the first time, I am very open to any advise which would help me improve.
