  <em>a night sky with trees and stars</em>
  
  <em>Sleeping with the stars at Bear Lake - I did my best to stay up as late as I could to capture the milky way. A good amount of moonlight makes capturing the milky way in all of its glory is challenging but the landscape and stars are still as beautiful as can be and awe-inspiring.</em>
